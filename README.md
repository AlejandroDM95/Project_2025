# Molecular Dynamics Simulation of a Van der Waals Gas

Simple molecular dynamics program that deal with a Van der Waals gas of
particles. This program was developed as a part of the final assignment of the
Advanced Computer Tools subject.

## Compiling and running the simulation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Eines-Informatiques-Avancades/Project_2025.git
$ cd Project_2025
$ make
```

## Dependencies

- A Fortran compiler (E.g.: [GNU Fortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/))
